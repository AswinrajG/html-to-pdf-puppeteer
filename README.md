# html-to-pdf-puppeteer

Its has always been a challenge for many developers to generate PDF from html on server side.
There are scenarios like where we need to generate a PDF invoice for a customer, save it on server as well as email them the PDF.

I am using a simple HTML invoice templete to demonstrate how we can use puppeteer and node js to create a pdf of it on server.
